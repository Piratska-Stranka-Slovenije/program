# Program
The Program encompasses seven principles, which are the platform for further discussions and creative endeavors of the party. These basic seven principles are the reflection of the Pirate Movement and provide the basis, on which the Party develops further solutions for society as a whole.
These seven points are not intended as a deterrent for the development of further principles. All new ideas will be formed in cooperation with all interested members. Every proposition submitted to members for the extension of this program, will be made by members themselves. The Party is implementing methods of Direct Electronic Democracy into its decision-making process. We're developing a system, which will give every member the possibility and right of co-creating the Party's policies and of influencing its further development.

## Respecting Human Rights

We fight for non-negotiable and complete protection and enforcement of all Human Rights, which are fundamental for the development of an open society and personal freedom. We fight for a state that is in service of its citizen. Politics must be used to the benefit of all people, not just for the benefit of specific groups. We are against any and all limitations of personal privacy, against censorship, and against prosecution of citizens that publicly state their opinions and convictions. We fight to protect all Human Rights, not just the ones regarding the internet.
Privacy and Data Protection

## Privacy and Data Protection

We fight for strict limitations to public surveillance and control, as information technology enables very refined methods of surveillance. All such breaches of privacy must be prevented, except in special cases defined by law. The surveillance of an individual's data and digital traffic is tolerable only based on a warrant issued by the competent court of law. An individual must have unconditional access to all data and information a body or agency of the state gathered on him, with the exception of data and information pertaining to or gathered in an ongoing investigation, as defined by law. The individual has the option to demand a limitation of access to these data and information, or a correction or deletion thereof.
Free and Neutral Internet

## Free and Neutral Internet

We fight for a constitutionally provided right to internet access. The internet must remain free and neutral. On the internet, all users have equal and unlimited access to all content, regardless of their service provider, software, or other individual differences. We fight for the equality of all services and protocols. The state and service providers may only intervene in data transfers based on legislative provisions or judicial warrants, and only based on well-founded suspicion of criminal activity. All users and services must, at all times, have the contracted internet bandwidth available to them, without any limitations.
Transparency of Government and Politics

## Transparency of Government and Politics

We fight for a transparent government and politics. Transparency is the fundamental condition for an independent, fair and principled functioning of politics and state in the interest of all citizens. The state must serve all citizens, not just specific groups. Its actions and transactions must be completely transparent, which is already attainable by information technology.
Copyright Monopoly Reform

## Copyright Monopoly Reform

We fight for a Copyright Law reform. Created works are the result of access to the treasure of all human knowledge, and they should be returned there, to be available for everybody. We recognize the importance of creators in society and fight for a fair compensation for authors for their work when creating knowledge and content. Authors' rights are disproportionate to the rights of the industry, which uses its stronger position. This suffocates the creativity, innovativeness and accessibility of knowledge. Another problem is the duration of copyright monopoly of a copyrighted work. Finally, copyright monopoly cannot and must not supersede the constitutionally guaranteed Right to Privacy.
Open Standards and Formats

## Open Standards and Formats

Users of various systems only have the option to freely and continually use data of all kinds, when these are in a form prescribed by an open standard. The same rule applies for various technical systems, which can only work together fully and properly, when their interfaces are made according to specifications in open standards. We fight for the use and spread of open standards and open formats, because this is the only way in which the dependency on individual producers can be diminished, which will strengthen a free competition of possible technical solutions.
Free Software

## Free Software

We fight for support for development and use of software, which can be used, studied, extended and changed without limitations. Free software provides all basic freedoms to its users, which are necessary for taking control over one's own technical systems. Educational institutions and the whole Public Service System must be enabled to gradually transfer their technical infrastructure to free software. In the long term, this will lower costs and dependency on individual producers.
